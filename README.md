# SeasonsTest

Just a test project for messing around with stuff.


## Credits

Unity is the game engine.

The graphical stuff is mainly from Kenny's Assets.

I made the scripts and put it all together.


## Copyright and License

It's copyrighted and there is no license specified.  That means it all goes to the default rule of "look but don't touch!"

Honestly though, I don't really care.  I just haven't decided on the licensing yet.  This was meant to be a private repo to share with certain people, but GitHub limits me to 3 collaborators unless I pay.  I'm perfectly okay with making it public and without a license instead.  ;)

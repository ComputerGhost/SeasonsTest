# SeasonsTest

Just a test project for messing around with stuff.


## Credits

Unity is the game engine.

The graphical stuff is mainly from Kenny's Assets.

I made the scripts and put it all together.

You'll notice there is no license.  Yep!  You can only read this stuff!  Mwuhahahaha!  You'll need my express permission to use any of my code.

Do note that the lack of a license only applies to my stuff.  I gave credits above for the stuff that I don't own.
